# Comparison-Data
These scripts were created to perform a comparison between two text files and output a new text file with the lines that don't match in the origional files.  All files in this repository are made for the direct purpose of comparing two specific text files that already have been obtained prior to writing the script and wwere wrote with this in mind.
